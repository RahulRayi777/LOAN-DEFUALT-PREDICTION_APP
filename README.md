# Loan Default Prediction App 🚀

# 📌 Overview

This project predicts loan defaults using machine learning models. Financial institutions use such predictions to assess risk and make better lending decisions.

# 📊 Features & Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing

Handles missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
Scales and encodes categorical variables.

# 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🕵️‍♂️

Visualizations with Matplotlib & Seaborn 📊
Distribution plots of key features.
Correlation heatmap for feature selection.
Boxplots to detect outliers.

# 3️⃣ Feature Selection & Dimensionality Reduction

Uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for better performance.


# 4️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation 🎯

Models used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC Curve.


# 5️⃣ Deployment & User Interface 🖥️

Deployed using Flask / Streamlit for user-friendly interaction.
